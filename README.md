# RoomGrub

RoomGrub is a simple and intuitive app designed for working bachelors and groups of friends who share living spaces. Whether you're splitting rent, tracking groceries, managing gas bills, or keeping tabs on monthly expenses, RoomGrub makes it effortless to organize and share costs with your roommates.

## Why RoomGrub?

- **Easy calculations:** No more manual math or confusion about who owes what.
- **Monthly collections:** Quickly organize and collect money for monthly expenses.
- **Transparent sharing:** See all expenses and shares, so nothing gets missed.

## Features

- **Expense Tracking:** Log every shared expense and see how much each person owes or has paid.
- **Automated Split:** Instantly calculate everyone's share, even for uneven splits.
- **Monthly Summary:** Review your total spending and settle up at the end of each month.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Simple, modern UI for quick and easy access from your phone or computer.
- **History & Reports:** View past expenses and download summaries for your records.
